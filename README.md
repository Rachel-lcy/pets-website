## Design Decision

``Visual Layout:
A clean and modern design was chosen to ensure an intuitive user experience.

A masonry grid layout was implemented for the pet image gallery to create a visually appealing and organized display.

The dashboard page was designed with card components to categorize pet information effectively.

``Typography and Color Scheme:

The application uses a simple, readable font style to enhance accessibility.

Soft pastel and neutral colors were used to create a welcoming and warm atmosphere.

``Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

A flexible grid system ensures elements resize and rearrange dynamically based on the viewport.

```
